# Data from: Protein Set Transformer: A protein-based genome language model to power high diversity viromics

These datasets are associated with the manuscript "Protein Set Transformer: A protein-based genome language model powers high diversity viromics". ([https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.26.605391](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.26.605391))

## Dataset descriptions

This statement is relevant for the file references in the manuscript code: We refer to the processed data directly used for figure making as "Supplementary **Data**". Major datasets that are used throughout the manuscript are referred to as "**Datasets**". Due to the size of the "datasets", we have provided each dataset folder as individual tarballs.

## H5 file structure

The genome embedding files were compressed using `blosc:lz4`, so you may need to specifically use [pytables](https://www.pytables.org) (which is used in the PST code) to open these files if your H5-library does not come with these compressors.

The protein embedding files were similarly compressed using `blosc2:lz4`.

### Genome embeddings

The structure of each genome embedding H5 file is:

```text
*_genome_embeddings.h5
|__ctx-avg-large
|__ctx-avg-small
|__esm-large
|__esm-small
|__genslm
|__hyena-dna
|__kmer
|__pst-large
|__pst-small
```

Where each field contains the genome embedding matrix `Shape: (Number of viruses, Embedding dimension)` for the viruses in that dataset.

### Protein embeddings

#### ESM2 protein embeddings

The structure of each protein embedding H5 file is:

```text
*_inputs.graphfmt.h5
|__class_id # (N genomes,) viral realm label for each genome
|__data     # (N proteins, Embed dim) stacked ESM2 protein embeddings
|__ptr      # (N genomes + 1,) index pointer to access protein embeddings for each genome
|__sizes    # (N genomes,) number of proteins encoded by each genome
|__strand   # (N proteins,) strand label {-1, 1} for each protein according to pyrodigal/prodigal-gv
```

The `data` field is sorted by each genome and the order of proteins encoded in each genome. The protein embeddings are stored in CSR format, so the `ptr` field is an index pointer to compute offsets and start/stops for each genome. This format is used by [PyTorch-Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/introduction.html#mini-batches). The `class_id`Â is not required for inference.

#### vPST protein embeddings

```text
*_contextualized_proteins.h5
|__attn # (N proteins, N attn heads) per-head attention scores for each protein, normalized by each genome
|__ctx_ptn # (N proteins, Embed dim) stacked vPST contextualized protein embeddings
```

To prevent data duplication, we did not provide the genome pointers used for accessing chunks from the above matrices that correspond to specific genomes. These can be accessed from the ESM2 graph-formatted `.h5` files.

#### GenSLM ORF embeddings

```text
genslm_orf_embeddings.h5
|__training # (N proteins, Embed dim) stacked orf embeddings for all train virus proteins
|__test # (N proteins, Embed dim) stacked orf embeddings for all test virus proteins
```

To prevent data duplication, we did not provide the genome pointers used for accessing chunks from the above matrices that correspond to specific genomes. These can be accessed from the ESM2 graph-formatted `.h5` files.
